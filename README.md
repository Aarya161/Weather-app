# Weather-app
Weather App that displays current weather data for a user-specified city. The app will test your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including your ability to work with APIs, handle errors, handle asynchronous operations using Promises, and design a responsive user interface.
Objectives
You are required to build a weather application that:

Displays the current weather based on a user-inputted location (city name).
Fetches weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) using Promises.
Shows key weather information like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
Has a neat, user-friendly design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Requirements:-
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Weather Display
Create a form with an input field where users can enter a city name.
Add a submit button that triggers fetching weather data for the specified city.
Display the following weather details:
Temperature (e.g., 25°C or 77°F)
Humidity (e.g., 65%)
Weather Condition (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Rainy)
Weather Icon (use icons provided in the API response).
